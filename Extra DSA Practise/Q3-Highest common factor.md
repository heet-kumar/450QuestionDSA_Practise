# Highest Common Factor

Find the HCF(Highest Common Factor) of n number given in an integer array. Fill in the function HCF() and return the HCF.

## Example 1
- Input:
  - 3
  - {2,4,8}
- Output: 2
- Explaination: The common factor for 2,4,8 are 1 and 2. Hence the HCF is 2.

## Example 2
- Input:
  - 5
  - {10,15,20,35,70}
- Output: 5
- Expalination: The common factor for 10,15,20,35,70 are 1 and 5. Hence the HCF is 5.

## Input format:
- The size of array
- elements of the array

## Output format:
- Return the HCF of the given number
